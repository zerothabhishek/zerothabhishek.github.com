Last Saturday I happened to attend a ruby-on-rails bugmash in Bangalore. I had to travel there from Chennai (where I live), and the experience was totally worth the effort. Here's a summary in FAQ format :  

- What is a _bugmash_?
Bugmash is an event where a group of programming enthusiasts gather to fix bugs in an open source project. That's not an exact definition, but kind of describes the idea. The open source project here was [ruby on rails](http://github.com/rails/rails), and the enthusiasts were the members of the [Bangalore ruby user group](http://groups.google.com/group/bangalorerug). 

- Who organized it? Where? How? When? ...
[Prakash Murthy](http://twitter.com/_prakash ) sent an [email on the group](http://groups.google.com/group/bangalorerug/browse_thread/thread/f5762acf66eda4b7#), which got everyone excited. [Castle rock research](http://www.castlerockresearch.in) ([hemant](http://gnufied.org)) hosted it, and sponsored the lunch also (thanks!). Saturday 21st May 2011. The attendance was managed through a nice web app called [plancast](http://plancast.com). 15 people attended (Prakash, Hemant, Prateek, Bhavin, Mithin, Sanath, Arun, Karunakaran, Vishnu, Neeraj, Satish, Ganesh, Manoj, me).

- How was it conducted? How did it proceed?
Everyone was asked to - 
. Join #bugmashblr on IRC  
. Pair with someone  
. Go through the bugs at rails issue tracker, and choose one.  
. Try verifying that the bug exists  
. Make changes and create a pull request
