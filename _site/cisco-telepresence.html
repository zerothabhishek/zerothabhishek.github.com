<p>This is Cisco&#8217;s telepresence magic !</p>

<p><strong>What it appears</strong>: DeBeer in US, Chambers in India, but both appear on a stage, together, (in India), and both are talking-laughing-discussing-every thing except shaking hands.</p>

<p><strong>What they want us to believe</strong>: Cisco has discovered magic. Something like a sci-fi virtual reality movie.</p>

<p><strong>What we guess</strong>: Perhaps they have discovered some 3D projection technology which they are using to duplicate the 3D video data they are capturing from a remote location and sending through high bandwidth channels. Not for everyone right now, only the corporate biggies are going to use it, but the technology is here.</p>

<p><strong>The reality</strong>: Look at this <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Telepresence'>wikipedia page</a>. Cisco&#8217;s Telepresence &#8221;&#8230;provides high-definition 1080p video, spatial audio, and a setup designed to link two physically separated rooms so they resemble a single conference room &#8230;&#8221;. Also, &#8221; ..The setup for the system include special tables, microphones, speakers, cameras, and lighting &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>So how is the &#8216;innovation&#8217; Chambers is so loud about (star trek and all) any different from a normal video-conferencing apparatus? The video quality is superior (1080p high-definition), agreed, but not the best available in market. 2K/4K digital cinema technology is commercially available, and ultra-high definition video is in the research phase (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television#High-Definition_Display_Resolutions'>the comparison</a>). And the sound? We already use lifelike sound in many of our electronic appliances. And then the lights-camera-action (and tables), are what a technology company should claim to be so proud about? Does it not look like just an assembly of high-performing products, already available in market, garnished with a disgustingly fake marketing campaign (which includes this video)? Bollywood song-choreographers can do it better.</p>

<p>And not to forget the price tag - $249000 - close to a crore rupees.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/ns669/networking_solutions_products_genericcontent0900aecd80546cd0.html'>product</a> itself is pretty honest about its capabilities, but what makes it look flimsy-shallow is the way Mr Chambers chose to present it in India, as shown in the video.</p>
