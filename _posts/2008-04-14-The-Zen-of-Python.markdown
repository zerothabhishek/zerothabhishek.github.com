Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
__Simple is better than complex.__  
Complex is better than complicated.  
Flat is better than nested.  
Sparse is better than dense.  
Readability counts.  
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
Although __practicality beats purity.__  
Errors should never pass silently.  
Unless explicitly silenced.  
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
Now is better than never.  
Although never is often better than *right* now.  
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

So much philosophy behind a computer-programming language?  
Well, yes! The programs in python do follow the above aphorisms.  
I can vouch for at least the highlighted ones.
